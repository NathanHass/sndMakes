### How might we help content creators visualize what platform their content will be represented on and how it'll be represented?


#### What you need to get going... _I think_

1. npm
2. npm modules (_this is the manual way, should add package.json to handle_)

        npm install node-static
        npm install cheerio
        npm install request
        npm install embedly

2. compass

        gem install compass

3. bower

        npm install bower
        bower install

#### Server stuff

1. Run `node server.js`
2. Open browser to http://localhost:8000
2. API to get the metadata is /url=YOUR-URL
