### How might we help content creators visualize what platform their content will be represented on and how it'll be represented?


#### What you need to get going... _I think_

1. npm
2. compass
 - run `gem install compass`

#### Server stuff

1. Run node server.js, listen on localhost:8000
2. API to get the metadata is /url=YOUR-URL
